Identity
========

> Not yet supported in the SDK!

The SDK doesn't currently contain any helper annotations, classes or interfaces to ease integration of identity, but it's
on our roadmap. [Let us know](https://github.com/manywho/sdk-java/issues) if it's a blocker for you and we'll see how
we can help.

It's still possible to use all the raw API objects and write your own identity controllers though, and some examples of 
this are located in our ManyWho Identity Service:

* [Authentication](https://github.com/manywho/service-identity/blob/master/src/main/java/com/manywho/services/identity/authentication/AuthenticationController.java)
* [Authorization](https://github.com/manywho/service-identity/blob/master/src/main/java/com/manywho/services/identity/authorization/AuthorizationController.java)
